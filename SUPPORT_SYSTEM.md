## Usage Examples

### Basic Ticket Creation

```tsx
import TicketCreateForm from "@/components/support/TicketCreateForm";

function CreateTicketPage() {
  const handleTicketCreated = (ticket) => {
    // Handle successful ticket creation
  };

  return <TicketCreateForm onTicketCreated={handleTicketCreated} />;
}
```

### Ticket Listing with Search

```tsx
import TicketList from "@/components/support/TicketList";

function TicketsPage() {
  const handleTicketSelect = (ticket) => {
    // Navigate to ticket conversation
  };

  return <TicketList onTicketSelect={handleTicketSelect} showActions={true} />;
}
```

### Conversation View

```tsx
import TicketConversation from "@/components/support/TicketConversation";

function ConversationPage({ ticketId }) {
  const handleBack = () => {
    // Navigate back to ticket list
  };

  return <TicketConversation ticketId={ticketId} onBack={handleBack} />;
}
```

## Validation & Security

### Form Validation

```typescript
// Subject validation
if (!subject || subject.trim().length < 3) {
  errors.subject = ["Subject must be at least 3 characters long"];
}

// Message validation
if (!message || message.trim().length < 10) {
  errors.message = ["Message must be at least 10 characters long"];
}

// File validation
const maxFileSize = 5 * 1024 * 1024; // 5MB
const allowedTypes = [
  "image/jpeg",
  "image/png",
  "application/pdf",
  "text/plain",
  "application/msword",
];
```
